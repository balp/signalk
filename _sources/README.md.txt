Signalk Library for Rust
========================

This library gives a rust native datatype for storing [signalk
data](https://signalk.org/). It can be used to either create a
SignalK server or client.

Some parts of the full SignalK protocoll is still missing, it can take all
data generated ny the n2k and nmea0183 sample data for the node-server and
handle as rust data.
